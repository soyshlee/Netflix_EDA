# Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project investigates patterns in Netflix's catalog to understand what factors play a critical role in Netflix's decision to produce or acquire certain movies or tv-shows. The three factors that will be focused on are: release periods, genres, and maturity ratings. By examining these together, we can discover how Netflix's production strategy and audience targeting shape its media library.
